	<h1>Hello Im Luy</h1>
	<p>It's pronounce (Louie) but spelled Luy. I was born in New York and raised in Mexico where my parents are from.
  I am the third and only boy in the family and second the graduate from college. I attended elementary and part of middle school
  in the states but was sent to study abroad in Mexico. I absolutely loved my time in Mexico it was an unforgettable experience
  but I would always visit the States on holidays. During my time in Mexico I learned about graphic designs and landscape photography
  which made my interest more desirable in media. I was orginally going to attend the university in Mexico but moved back to the States
  and pursued my first step to media technology in Laguardia Community College. The things I learned while in college like photoshop
  and video editing made me realize I can enjoy my career while also entertaining myself. The best part is now I am back in the city
  where I am surronded by media and opportunities to join a media industry. I sincerely hope to live up the dream of every New Yorker
  and will continue my studies in media technology.</p>
